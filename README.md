# Computer-Graphics-Rendering-and-Visualization
For this course work, the aim was to visualize curves, surfaces and solid shapes defined by simple mathematical formulas. The main functions were to define shapes by implicit, explicit and parametric analytic functions, make shape morphing transformations and motions, and coloring shapes using mathematical functions. The software tools used include BS Contact VRML/X3D viewer, FVRML plug-in, and VrmlPad editor and viewer.

There are a total of 5 experiments:
  - Experiment 1: Parametric Curves
  - Experiment 2: Parametric Surfaces
  - Experiment 3: Parametric Solids
  - Experiment 4: Implicit Surfaces and Solids
  - Experiment 5: Transformations and Motions
